# Production Defect Detection System with Python

**System Explanation**

There are boxes containing different numbers of balls, at least 5 balls. Different boxes may contain balls of different weights. However, the balls in a box must have the same weight. If the weight of only 1 ball in a box differs from the others, it is considered reasonable, but if the weight of more than 1 ball differs from the others, it is considered a manufacturing defect and the box is returned. 

**NOTE:** To run the program, you just need to download the zip file from Releases and run the exe file in Console.
